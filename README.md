## 📚 Core Modules

### **🧬 Omics Vocabulary Intelligence**
A searchable, filterable database of advanced terminology. Each entry includes:
*   **Academic Definition:** Rigorous explanations suitable for thesis writing.
*   **Research Context:** Examples of how the term is used in peer-reviewed abstracts.
*   **Domain Filtering:** Sort by Genomics, Metabolomics, or Genetic Engineering.

### **📖 Interactive Research Reading**
Practice comprehension with real scientific texts.
*   **Smart Annotation:** Hover over complex terms to see instant definitions.
*   **Comprehension Checks:** Interactive quizzes to test understanding of nuance and detail.

### **✍️ Scientific Writing Assistant**
An NLP-powered tool to refine your abstracts and manuscripts.
*   **Tone Analysis:** Detects informal language ("kids", "huge") vs. academic language ("children", "significant").
*   **Passive Voice Detection:** Highlights areas where active voice could improve clarity.
*   **Readability Metrics:** Instant feedback on sentence complexity.
